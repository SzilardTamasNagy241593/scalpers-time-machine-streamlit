# Scalper’s Time Machine

A machine learning-powered financial tool that classifies short-term stock trends and simulates investment strategies. Built using scikit-learn, Gradio, and good ol' human frustration.

> Predict it, plot it, simulate it — like a hedge fund but way cheaper.

## How to run locally

```bash
poetry install
python app.py
